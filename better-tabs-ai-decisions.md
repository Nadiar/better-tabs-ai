## ðŸ”´ Critical Decisions (Must Answer)

### 1. AI Model Strategy

**Question 1a**: Which AI model should be the primary choice?
**Context**: Chrome has built-in Gemini Nano (free, local), but requires user consent and has hardware requirements. Hugging Face has free API tiers but requires internet.
**Options**:
- [X] Chrome Gemini Nano only (purely local, but limited availability)
- [ ] Hugging Face API only (always available, but requires API key)
- [ ] Chrome Gemini Nano primary with Hugging Face fallback (best of both worlds)
- [ ] Let user choose in settings

**Default recommendation**: Chrome Gemini Nano primary with Hugging Face fallback
**YOUR ANSWER**:  Lets do the first one, I marked it with an X

---

**Question 1b**: How should we handle AI model unavailability?
**Context**: Gemini Nano may not be available on all systems (GPU requirements, storage space, etc.)
**Options**:
- [X] Show error message and disable extension
- [ ] Automatically fallback to Hugging Face (if API key provided)
- [ ] Use simple domain-based grouping as final fallback
- [ ] Combination of fallbacks with user notification

**Default recommendation**: Combination of fallbacks with user notification
**YOUR ANSWER**: Lets do the first one, I marked it with an X

### 2. Tab Content Analysis Strategy

**Question 2a**: How much content should we analyze per tab?
**Context**: More content = better AI understanding but slower processing and higher token usage
**Options**:
- [ ] Page title + meta description only (fast, limited context)
- [ ] First 500 characters of text content (balanced)
- [ ] First 1000 characters of text content (more context)
- [ ] Full page content (thorough but expensive)
- [ ] User configurable limit

**Default recommendation**: First 500 characters with user configurable limit
**YOUR ANSWER**:  Can we use a staged approach, that starts with the metadata, and prompts to expand through options if it still can't determine the content?

---

**Question 2b**: When should tabs be analyzed?
**Context**: Real-time analysis vs batch processing affects performance and user experience
**Options**:
- [ ] Immediately when tab is created/updated (real-time)
- [X] On user demand only (manual trigger)
- [ ] Periodic batch processing (every 5 minutes)
- [ ] Smart triggers (when tab loads, on idle, etc.)

**Default recommendation**: Smart triggers (when tab loads, on idle)
**YOUR ANSWER**: The second option, which I marked with an X

---

### 3. Grouping Strategy

**Question 3a**: What should be the default grouping criteria?
**Context**: Different approaches provide different levels of organization
**Options**:
- [ ] By domain only (simple, fast)
- [X] By topic/category (AI-determined themes)
- [ ] By content type (articles, videos, shopping, etc.)
- [ ] Hybrid approach (domain + AI categorization)
- [ ] User-defined custom categories

**Default recommendation**: Hybrid approach (domain + AI categorization)
**YOUR ANSWER**:  User-Defined approach would be great for a future revision, so we should try to make sure our implementation can be expanded in that way, but we don't need to support it right now.

---

**Question 3b**: How should existing tab groups be handled?
**Context**: Users may already have manually created groups
**Options**:
- [ ] Never modify existing groups
- [ ] Only organize ungrouped tabs
- [X] Ask permission before modifying existing groups
- [X] Provide option to merge similar groups

**Default recommendation**: Only organize ungrouped tabs with option to merge similar groups
**YOUR ANSWER**:  If it seems like a page needs to be added to a group, prompt for that, if it seems like we have similar groups that were not Manually created, We should have an option to merge them, as they may be from different browser instances.

## ðŸŸ¡ Design Clarifications

### 4. User Interface Design

**Question 4a**: What should the main popup interface show?
**Context**: Limited popup space needs to prioritize most important features
**Options**:
- [ ] Current tab analysis + quick actions
- [ ] All tab groups overview
- [ ] Settings and configuration
- [ ] Tabbed interface with multiple views
- [X] Minimal with link to full-page interface

**Default recommendation**: Tabbed interface with analysis, groups, and settings views
**YOUR ANSWER**:  I like the idea of the popup interface being minimal, with a link to a full-page interface

---

**Question 4b**: How should AI-suggested groups be presented?
**Context**: Users need to understand and approve AI decisions
**Options**:
- [ ] Auto-apply with undo option
- [ ] Show preview with approve/reject buttons
- [ ] List suggestions with checkboxes
- [X] Interactive drag-and-drop interface

**Default recommendation**: Show preview with approve/reject buttons
**YOUR ANSWER**:  That option 4 isn't what I was imagnining, but that sounds awesome, lets do that, I marked it with an X.

---

### 5. Configuration Options

**Question 5a**: What settings should be user-configurable?
**Context**: Too many options overwhelm users, too few limit flexibility
**Options**:
- [ ] AI model preference only
- [ ] Analysis frequency and content limits
- [ ] Grouping criteria and rules
- [ ] All of the above + UI preferences
- [X] Minimal settings with smart defaults

**Default recommendation**: Analysis frequency, grouping criteria, and AI model preference
**YOUR ANSWER**:  As we're keeping this light, I think the required options we have discussed in this design are acceptable, along with whatever else is required.  The UI allowing drag and Drop groups should make some of the nitpicky options irrelevent.

---

**Question 5b**: Should the extension require API keys setup?
**Context**: Ease of use vs functionality trade-off
**Options**:
- [ ] Require Hugging Face API key for any AI features
- [ ] Work without API key using Chrome AI only
- [ ] Optional API key for enhanced features
- [ ] Provide built-in free quota for basic usage

**Default recommendation**: Optional API key for enhanced features, Chrome AI as default
**YOUR ANSWER**:  I think earlier I said no, but lets assume this might be a feature we add in the future.

## ðŸŸ¢ Nice-to-Have Features (Can Skip)

### 6. Advanced Features

**Question 6a**: Should we include tab productivity features?
**Context**: Additional features beyond basic grouping
**Options**:
- [ ] Tab usage analytics (time spent, frequency)
- [X] Duplicate tab detection and merging
- [I] Automatic tab archiving for old tabs
- [X] Tab search and filtering
- [X] Focus mode (hide distracting groups)

**Default recommendation**: Start with duplicate detection and tab search
**YOUR ANSWER**: I marked 4 different ones. The ones marked with X are definite inclusions, but the one marked with an I would be useful as a manual trigger.

---

**Question 6b**: Should we support custom grouping rules?
**Context**: Power users may want to define their own rules
**Options**:
- [ ] Simple keyword-based rules
- [ ] Regular expression patterns
- [ ] Visual rule builder interface
- [ ] AI-learned patterns from user behavior
- [X] No custom rules (keep it simple)

**Default recommendation**: Simple keyword-based rules for v1
**YOUR ANSWER**: We're just going to keep it simple for now.

### 7. Performance and Storage

**Question 7a**: How should we handle large numbers of tabs?
**Context**: Some users have 100+ tabs open
**Options**:
- [ ] Process all tabs regardless of count
- [ ] Limit analysis to most recent X tabs
- [ ] Prioritize active/recently used tabs
- [X] Ask user permission for large batches

**Default recommendation**: Prioritize active/recently used tabs with user permission for large batches
**YOUR ANSWER**:  Lets do option 4, marked with an X, but we should also ignore existing tab groups if there are a large number of tabs to process.

---

**Question 7b**: What data should we store locally?
**Context**: Balance between functionality and privacy
**Options**:
- [X] Only user settings and preferences
- [X] Tab analysis cache (titles, summaries)
- [ ] Full tab content for offline analysis
- [ ] User grouping patterns and learning data

**Default recommendation**: User settings and tab analysis cache (no full content)
**YOUR ANSWER**:
